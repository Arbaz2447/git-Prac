making a folder into repo

navigate to that folder in terminal -> git init 
to track which files are updated or to get status -> git status 

to clone some repo into local system -> git clone https://github.com/Nani4481/Codechef-website sakethWeb    || git clone url FolderName to be saved in pwd 

Note : parent folder if we make it repo then sub folders are also a repo ! 
changed files / modified files are also vieweed by -> git status

to verify what changes are actually made -> git diff 

3 environment in git temp area ( all temp changes are made here) , 
                staging index (about to commit ) -> git add filename
                repo area (permanent changes) -> git commit

to commit -> git commit -m "message"

to get recent commits or commit ids / details -> git log  or git log -5 
in detail for all commits with git diff-> git log -p

for simple one line  just commit id and message -> git log --oneline

for in detail for specific commit , what changes are made in file -> git show cmtid
for file change count , how many files are changed , Number of lines changed -> git log --stat



git add -> old files sends to staging index // new files starts tracking !
git restore file_name -> restores to recent commit ,to Recent -> head


git branch -> shows branches 
git branch branch_name -> creates new branch
git checkout branch_name ->  moves to branch_name

git checkout -p branch_name -> creates and moves to new branch !
git commit -am "msg" -> for new file add and commit ! 

git merge branch_name -> merges if done in master 
git branch -d branch_name -> delete branch after merge 

to verify some merge conflict we manually solve and then later -> git add file_name , later commit 


git tag -a TAG_NAME sha_id -m "msg" -> add tag to some branch 
git tag -d TAG_NAME -> remove tag







GIT STASH :

  You written some code and want to merge  with master , 
    in order to do that you need current updated codebase ! you need to pull that first 
    -----> git pull
if you have any unsaved/ files you cannot pull , eaither stash them or commit them 

stash area is temp area , you store your code and pull latest code and unstash
-----> git stash apply  later merge conflict then ----->git add in order to staging idx ! 


after conflicts push into remote
git push -u origin master 


Remove file from staging index (but keep changes)
git restore --staged filename


Git Stash vs commit in pull :
you save the worked data in branch (local) and you have 2 options , -> 1 . stash them  pull and apply the worked changes (not saved )them on latest remote data  and reslove .  -> 2 .  commit (worked temp  changes) you commit and pull and later merge ! when you are sure abt worked data you commit and pull , when unsure stash and pull !
